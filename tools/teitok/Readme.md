# Local installation

For *local* installation, we recommend using [TEITOK](http://www.teitok.org/index.php?action=help&id=download).
Build with

  $> make

(This will take a while, it will need internet access and require some user input along the way.)

This implements the [recommended](http://www.teitok.org/index.php?action=help&id=download) TEITOK installation.
Note that it will request root access and impose a pre-defined directory structure.
If uncertain about security risks and not interested in checking the details:
If you trust the TEITOK developers, this is *ok* for an installation on your local PC,
but it is *absolutely not recommended* for a publicly exposed server.

For this purpose, the other tools provided in sibling directories will provide the ETCSANS integration into the CDLI framework.
The CDLI framework itself can also be locally replicated, but will require some more effort in comparison to TEITOK.
